# Stock Analysis

## About the Project

Stock analysis is a fundamental aspect of financial trading. Thus, I decided to venture towards a platform that would make it simple and quick for a user to pull stock data for as many stocks as they would like. After examining price data, the user may then conduct his/her analysis by plotting the technical indicators of their choice.

Currently, the project contains two files:

* A base file that allows one to conduct their analysis in a Python IDE
* A more complex file that allows one to access a GUI to conduct their analysis in a more user-friendly way

## Future Projects

As I continue to grow and build off my knowledge of Python, I hope to build off this project to develop more complex programs. I plan for this Stock Analysis project to be a small cog in a larger, overarching project. I will be developing various programs that allow one to automate the stock analysis process and utilize machine learning to develop a strategy for maximum profits. This algortihmic trading platform should automate all parts of the trading process, including portfolio allocation, and will have functionality with various financial instruments (stocks, options, forex, futures, etc.).
